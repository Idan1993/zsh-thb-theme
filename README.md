# htb-zsh-theme

After spending some time using the pwnbox on a HackTheBox machine, I really enjoyed its terminal setup. However, I couldn't find any easy sources to make my Kali Linux terminal look similar. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and customize my terminal to create a personalized and stylish experience that I love.

> **Note:** If you are connected to the Hackthebox VPN, you will see the IP address of the tun0 interface (VPN interface); otherwise, you will see the IP address of the local machine's eth0 interface.

## Usage
Simply append the content of ibyf0r.zsh to the end of your ~/.zshrc file.
